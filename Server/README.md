# STDISCM Problem Set 2 - Server.Particle Simulator w/ Explorer Mode
*Samuel Derrick Nieva, Viktoria Lila Sicuan (S12)*

## Description
This Java program serves as a particle physics simulator with border-bouncing capabilities. It allows users to visualize and simulate the behavior of particles within a defined environment, observing their interactions and collisions with borders.

## How to Run
To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Access the `src` directory.
2. Compile the Java files by executing the following command in the terminal or command prompt:
    ```
    javac *.java
    ```
3. After successful compilation, run the program by executing:
    ```
    java Server.Main
    ```
4. This will launch the GUI interface where you can interact with the particle simulator.

Alternatively, you can run the program using IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Build the application.
3. Run the `Server.Main.java` file.

## Usage
Once the program is running, you can:

- Define the initial parameters of the particle generation.
- Observe the behavior of particles as they move within the defined environment.
- Visualize collisions between particles and borders.
- Customize the properties of particles and the simulation environment.
